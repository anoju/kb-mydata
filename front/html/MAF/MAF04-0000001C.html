                    to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br /><br />

                    ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
                    elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br /><br />

                    ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is

                    the purposes of this definition, ""submitted"" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited
                    to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of

                    ""Contributor"" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative
                    Works in Source or Object form.<br /><br />

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such
                    license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
                    that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for
                    that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br /><br />

                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
                    provided that You meet the following conditions:<br /><br />

                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br /><br />

                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and<br /><br />

                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and<br /><br />

                    (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text
                    file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
                    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
                    may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
                    attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br /><br />

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this
                    License.<br /><br />

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
                    license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
                    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS""
                    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
                    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
                    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br /><br />

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
                    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
                    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages.<br /><br />

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
                    warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
                    Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
                    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br /><br />

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />

                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br /><br />

                    to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br /><br />

                    ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
                    elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br /><br />

                    ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,

                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and<br /><br />

                    (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text
                    file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
                    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
                    may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
                    attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br /><br />

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this

                    terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
                    license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
                    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS""
                    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

                    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br /><br />

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
                    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
                    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages.<br /><br />

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,

                    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
                    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
                    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br /><br />

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
                    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
                    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages.<br /><br />

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
                    warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
                    Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
                    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br /><br />

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION<br /><br />

                    1. Definitions.<br /><br />

                    ""License"" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.<br /><br />

                    documentation, and conversions to other media types.<br /><br />

                    ""Work"" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached
                    to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br /><br />

                    ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
                    elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br /><br />

                    ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is
                    intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For
                    the purposes of this definition, ""submitted"" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited
                    to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of

                    ""Contributor"" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the
                    Work.<br /><br />

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative
                    Works in Source or Object form.<br /><br />

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such
                    license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
                    that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for
                    that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br /><br />

                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
                    provided that You meet the following conditions:<br /><br />

                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br /><br />

                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and<br /><br />

                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and<br /><br />

                    (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text
                    file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
                    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
                    may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
                    attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br /><br />

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this
                    License.<br /><br />

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
                    license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
                    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS""
                    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
                    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
                    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br /><br />

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
                    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
                    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages.<br /><br />

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
                    warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
                    Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
                    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br /><br />

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
                    license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
                    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS""

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
                    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
                    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages.<br /><br />

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
                    warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
                    Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
                    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br /><br />

                    to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br /><br />

                    ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
                    elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br /><br />

                    ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,

                    (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text
                    file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
                    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
                    may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional

                    terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate

                    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />

                    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or

                    attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br /><br />

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
                    license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
                    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS""

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
                    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
                    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages.<br /><br />

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
                    warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
                    Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
                    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br /><br />

                    to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br /><br />

                    ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
                    elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br /><br />

                    ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative
                    Works in Source or Object form.<br /><br />

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,

                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and<br /><br />

                    (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text
                    file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
                    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
                    may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional

                    terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
                    license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
                    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS""
                    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

                    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br /><br />

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
                    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
                    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages.<br /><br />

                    may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
                    attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br /><br />

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
                    license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
                    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS""

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
                    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
                    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages.<br /><br />

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
                    warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
                    Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
                    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br /><br />

                    ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
                    elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br /><br />

                    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />

                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or

                    contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text
                    file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
                    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
                    may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
                    attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br /><br />

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this
                    License.<br /><br />

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
                    license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
                    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS""
                    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
                    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
                    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br /><br />

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
                    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
                    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages.<br /><br />

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
                    warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
                    Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
                    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br /><br />

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION<br /><br />

                    1. Definitions.<br /><br />

                    ""License"" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.<br /><br />

                    ""Legal Entity"" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of
                    this definition, ""control"" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of

                    documentation, and conversions to other media types.<br /><br />

                    ""Work"" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached
                    to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br /><br />

                    ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
                    elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br /><br />

                    ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is
                    intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For
                    the purposes of this definition, ""submitted"" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited
                    to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of
                    discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as ""Not a Contribution.""<br /><br />

                    ""Contributor"" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative
                    Works in Source or Object form.<br /><br />

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such
                    license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
                    that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for
                    that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br /><br />

                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,

                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and<br /><br />

                    (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text
                    file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
                    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
                    may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
                    attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br /><br />

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this
                    License.<br /><br />

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
                    license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
                    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS""
                    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

                    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br /><br />

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
                    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
                    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages.<br /><br />

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,

                    documentation, and conversions to other media types.<br /><br />

                    to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br /><br />

                    ""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
                    elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br /><br />

                    ""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is
                    intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For
                    the purposes of this definition, ""submitted"" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited
                    to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of
                    discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as ""Not a Contribution.""<br /><br />

                    ""Contributor"" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the
                    Work.<br /><br />

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative
                    Works in Source or Object form.<br /><br />

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such
                    license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
                    that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for
                    that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br /><br />

                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
                    provided that You meet the following conditions:<br /><br />

                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br /><br />

                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and<br /><br />

                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and<br /><br />

                    (d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text
                    file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
                    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
                    may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
                    attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br /><br />

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this
                    License.<br /><br />

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
                    license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br /><br />

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
                    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br /><br />

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS""
                    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
                    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
                    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br /><br />

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
                    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
                    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages.<br /><br />

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
                    warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
                    Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
                    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br /><br />

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />

                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br /><br />

                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets ""{}"" replaced with your own identifying information.
                    (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a file or class name and description of
                    purpose be included on the same ""printed page"" as the copyright notice for easier identification within third-party archives.<br /><br />
